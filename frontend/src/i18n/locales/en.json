      "description": "Hi! I’m Vitor Bressan, a self-taught developer with a degree in Analysis and Systems Development (ADS).\n\nMy main focus is Backend Web Development and APIs, using Python as my core language. I love working on the logic behind applications — building features, connecting systems, and making things run smoothly behind the scenes.\n\nOver the past few years, I’ve spent a lot of time studying programming on my own, creating personal projects, and exploring different areas of tech to understand what truly excites me. That curiosity naturally led me to backend development, where I feel most motivated and challenged.\n\nI’ve also gained professional experience in software development, collaborating with teams, solving technical problems, and learning how to deliver real solutions in a work environment.\n\nI’m always looking for new ways to improve — whether it’s learning new frameworks, understanding software architecture, or simply writing cleaner and more efficient code.\n\nMy current goal is to land a developer position, keep improving my skills, and contribute to projects that make a real impact."
